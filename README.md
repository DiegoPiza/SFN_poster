# Representation of 3D space in marmosets
These are supplementary materials and figures, to complement our 2021 SFN poster on neural recordings in the hippocampus of freely moving marmosets.

# Marmosets use rapid head movements to explore space

Marmosets have evolved to use head rotations in rapid saccade-like movements(Pandey et al, 2020), these movements help them orient their view to areas of visual interest.

Here we show selected trajectory examples of a marmoset in the gym when speeds were higher than 4 standard deviations of the mean for both angular (rapid head movement) and translation speed. The size of the marker is proportional to the time spent at that location, Red= angular speed movement, Blue= translation speed movement and Green = movement with both angular and translational components. We can observe that marmosets alternate between visual exploration and translation exploration.
